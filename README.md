Elixir library for [Lob API](https://lob.com/).

### This is an ALPHA library for the Lob API.

### Please reach out to support@lob.com for assistance if planning to implement this library.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `lob_elixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lob_elixir, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Getting Started

This library implements the Lob API. Please read through the official [API Documentation](#api-documentation) to get a complete sense of what to expect from each endpoint.

### Registration

The library requires a valid Lob API key to work properly. To acquire an API key, first create an account at [Lob.com](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register). Once you have created an account, you can access your API Keys from the [Settings Panel](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings).

### API Key Configuration
 The library will by default refer to the `:api_key` config when making authenticated requests. If that is not present, it will look for the `LOB_API_KEY` environment variable.

```elixir
# Configuring an API key with configs
config :lob_elixir,
  api_key: "your_api_key"
```

Similarly, the library allows users to optionally configure the API version through the `:api_version` config. If that is not present, it will look for the `LOB_API_VERSION` environment variable.

```elixir
# Configuring an API key and API version with configs
config :lob_elixir,
  api_key: "your_api_key",
  api_version: "2014-12-18"
```

### Usage

Requests return a 2-tuple or 3-tuple, depending on the response.

```elixir
# Successful response
{:ok, postcards, _headers} = Postcard.list()

# Unsuccessful response
{:error, %{message: ":nxdomain"}} = Postcard.list()

# Unsuccessful response with status code
{:error, %{message: "postcard not found", status_code: 404}} = Postcard.retrieve('nonexistent_resource')
```
